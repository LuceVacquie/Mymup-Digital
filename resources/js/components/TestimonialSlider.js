        making us compatible to submit data to the MHSDS. Our experience is that MYMUP have a good understanding of the differing needs we face as a smaller voluntary sector organisation trying to submit 
        data to a statutory body. We have had previous frustrations speaking directly with NHS Digital who have limited understanding of our service and processes and it has been really helpful and 
        supportive to have MYMUP as the advocate on our behalf. We find the team to be very approachable, quick to respond and highly supportive.`,
